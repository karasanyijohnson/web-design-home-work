                                    <p> Video production is the process of producing video content. It is the equivalent of filmmaking,
                                         but with images recorded digitally instead of on film stock. 
                                         here are three stages of video production: pre-production, production, 
                                         and post-production. 
                                         Pre-production involves all of the planning aspects of the video production process before filming begins.
                                          This includes scriptwriting, scheduling, logistics, and other administrative duties. 
                                          Production is the phase of video production which captures the video content (moving images / videography)
                                          and involves filming the subject(s) of the video. Post-production is the action of selectively 
                                          combining those video clips through video editing into a finished product that tells a story or 
                                          communicates a message in either a live event setting (live production), 
                                          or after an event has occurred (post-production)

                                    <p>A radio station is a set of equipment necessary to carry on communication via radio waves.
                                         Generally, it is a receiver or transmitter or transceiver, an antenna, 
                                         and some smaller additional equipment necessary to operate them. Radio stations play a vital
                                          role in communication technology as they are heavily relied on to transfer data and information-
                                          across the world.
                                          More broadly, the definition of a radio station includes the aforementioned
                                           equipment and a building in which it is installed. Such a station may include 
                                           several "radio stations" defined above (i.e. several sets of receivers or 
                                           transmitters installed in one building but functioning independently,
                                            and several antennas installed on a field next to the building). 
                                            This definition of a radio station is more often referred to as a transmitter 
                                            site, transmitter station, transmission facility or transmitting station.
